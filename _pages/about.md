Illustrated Atom, LLC. is a transparent opensource project that provides publication grade scientific illustration services for companies and academic labs. Illustrated Atom specialized in a variety of artistic styles that range from graphic design to atomically accurate 3D renderings. While all images posted here are open source to the scientific community, I welcome and prioritize special request projects/collaborations so feel free to reach out.
