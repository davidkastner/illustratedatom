Illustrated Atom, LLC. is a transparent opensource project that provides publication grade scientific illustration services for companies and academic labs. Illustrated Atom specialized in a variety of artistic styles that range from graphic design to atomically accurate 3D renderings. Many of the files are open source and free to use for everyone but if you want to give me a shout out, even better! Enjoy.
