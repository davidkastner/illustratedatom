Illustrated Atom, LLC. is a transparent opensource company that provides publication grade scientific illustration services for companies and academic labs. Illustrated Atom specialized in a variety of artistic styles that range from graphic design to atomically accurate 3D renderings. I usually include the source files to the scientific community at no extra cost for educational purposes. If you want to give me a shout out, even better! Enjoy.
